Analyze stock data with VBA

Overview of Project  

The purpose of this project is to help my fried Steve analyze Green Energy Stocks in order to help his parents understand the return on investment in each of the Green energy stocks.  The project automates the stock data analysis using VBA.

Results

Initially Steve's Parents were only interested in a company called DAQO Energy Corp.  They picked the stock based on emotion rather than quantitative analysis.  Using VBA we were able to search through the DAQO stock data and calculate a -63% return on investment in 2018.  This is a loss that did not meet the needs of Steve's parents.  We then used VBA to analyze other stocks in the same sector to determine if there were better return on investments.  We are recommending ENPH as a more lucrative alternative to DQ for Steve's parents.  ENPH had a 129% ROI in 2017 and 82% ROI in 2018.
